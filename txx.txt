t01: Unary operator priority
     Problem: A * -B + C
     Result:  A * -(B + C)

     NOTE:     for ! (logical not) it is kept for some reason!!!

t02: (?:) Returns freed temp
     Problem: (?:) is evaluated into temp0 and if used
     	      in a function call, any arithmetic in a later parameter
	      overwrites the (?:) parameter.
     Problem: f(x ? A : B, y * z)
     Result:  f(y*z, y*z)

t03: not a bug, in A ? B : C, C is greedy and not stopped by commas

t04: After a function call, the current expression level (priority) ends
     Problem: f(x) ? A : B
     Result: ? is unexpected by the compiler

t05: Unary operators do not support vectors.
     Problem: -some_vec
     Result: type mismatch for -
     After Implementation:
     	  Problem: QCC_PR_WriteProgdefs segfaults because vectpr immediates
	  	   do not have *_x *_y *_z variables.
     Can easily be avoided.
